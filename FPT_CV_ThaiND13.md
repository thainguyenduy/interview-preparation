### Convert Pro*C to Java

| | |
|---|---|
| **Project name** | Convert Pro*C to Java |
| **Period** | Feb 2025 - Present |
| **Position(s)** | Technical Lead |
| **Project description** | Converted legacy Pro*C (embedded SQL in C) codebases to modern Java using AI agents, prompt engineering, and context engineering. Designed a **Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow** to guarantee conversion correctness: first extracting and documenting expected behaviors from Pro*C source, then generating Java unit/integration tests as the acceptance criteria **before** any code conversion, and finally using AI agents to produce Java code that must pass all pre-written tests. This TDD-first approach ensured business logic preservation, data integrity, and zero-regression throughout the migration. Built intelligent conversion pipelines using GitHub Copilot agents, custom prompts, and structured instructions to automate and accelerate the process. |
| **Project type** | Time & Materials |
| **Team size** | TBD |
| **Tech Stack** | - **Source Language:** Pro*C (C with embedded SQL, Oracle) <br> - **Target Language:** Java (Spring Boot / JDBC) <br> - **Testing:** JUnit 5, Mockito, Integration Tests, Oracle Test DB <br> - **AI/Tools:** GitHub Copilot, AI Agents, Prompt Engineering, Context Engineering <br> - **Databases:** Oracle <br> - **Used Technologies:** GitHub Copilot Agents, VS Code, Git, Maven/Gradle |
| **Responsibilities** | - Build prompts, instructions, and agents using GitHub Copilot <br> - Design a **TDD-based conversion workflow**: (1) Analyze Pro*C source to extract business logic and SQL behavior, (2) Generate Java test cases (unit + integration) as acceptance criteria before conversion, (3) Use AI agents to convert Pro*C to Java, (4) Run tests to validate conversion, (5) Iterate until all tests pass <br> - Create test generation prompts that translate Pro*C behavior into JUnit test cases <br> - Design context engineering strategies: feeding Pro*C source, DB schema, and test expectations into AI agents for accurate conversion <br> - Define conversion rules and patterns from Pro*C embedded SQL to Java JDBC/Spring <br> - Build CI pipeline to run the full TDD test suite on every converted module <br> - Review and validate converted Java code against pre-written tests <br> - Ensure business logic preservation and data integrity through automated test coverage |
| **Project scope** | Test case design, prompt engineering, AI agent development, TDD workflow, code conversion, CI/CD integration, review, validation |

**Interviewer:** Can you give me a quick introduction about yourself?

**Thai:** I'm Nguyen Duy Thai, a Technical Lead at FPT with 18+ years of experience in software development. I graduated from Vietnam National University of Science in Computational and Applied Mathematics. Throughout my career, I've worked across various roles including Developer, Technical Lead, Solution Architect, and Project Manager. My core expertise includes Nodejs/Typescript, Flutter, PostgreSQL, and I'm recognized for my skills in Microservices, Domain Driven Design, Clean Architecture, and CQRS. I've led teams ranging from 2 to 20 members across diverse projects in logistics, e-commerce, ride-hailing, and enterprise systems.

---

**Interviewer:** Tell me about your strong points and weak points.

**Thai:** For my strong points - I have 12+ years of technical leadership experience, leading teams through the full SDLC from planning to delivery. I'm recognized for my architecture skills in Microservices, DDD, Clean Architecture, and CQRS. I'm also versatile with full-stack capability across Node.js, Flutter, React, and databases. I have extensive experience mentoring, teaching, and coaching dev teams. And I communicate smoothly in English with experience working with stakeholders.

For weak points - I sometimes spend extra time ensuring code quality and architecture decisions are optimal, which can slow initial delivery. I'm working on balancing perfectionism with pragmatic deadlines. Also, my React skills are at a practical application level compared to my advanced Node.js and Flutter expertise, but I'm actively improving this.

---

**Interviewer:** What's a new software or technology you recently worked with?

**Thai:** From December 2025 to January 2026, I worked on an MVP for an Internal Developer Portal using Backstage - an open-source platform by Spotify that unifies tools, services, and documentation into a single portal. It's built on React and Node.js with a plugin-based architecture. I was responsible for building the user permission system - defining policies, handling authorization, and controlling access to resources and plugins within the portal.

---

**Interviewer:** Apart from completing tasks, what values do you contribute to projects?

**Thai:** I contribute in several ways. For architecture and design, I create modern, practical, and reliable systems using Clean Architecture, DDD, and appropriate design patterns. I focus on knowledge transfer - teaching, mentoring, and coaching team members to grow their skills. I help with process improvement by implementing Scrum methodology, creating Definition of Done rules, and refining product backlogs. I ensure quality assurance through code reviews and establishing QA steps. I make technical decisions by selecting modern tech stacks that fit project needs. And I monitor sprint progress and track team performance.

---

**Interviewer:** If your leader assigned you a task but you have no experience with it, how would you solve it?

**Thai:** This happened recently with the AS/400/RPGLE project at SBS Ricoh. My approach was: First, self-learning - I researched documentation, tutorials, and best practices. Then I analyzed the existing code to understand patterns and conventions. I broke down the problem into smaller, manageable pieces. I asked for guidance from experienced colleagues and client experts. I prototyped and iterated - starting with small implementations, getting feedback, and improving. Finally, I documented my learnings and shared knowledge with the team to prevent future blockers.

---

**Interviewer:** If you have an idea to contribute to the project but no one agrees, what will you do to convince them?

**Thai:** I would prepare evidence first - gather data, benchmarks, or case studies supporting my idea. Then I'd create a prototype or POC to show rather than tell, demonstrating the solution working. I'd listen to objections and address concerns specifically. I'd find common ground by identifying shared goals and showing how my idea achieves them. I'd propose a pilot to test on a small scale and reduce risk. And if the team still disagrees after discussion, I'd respect the collective decision while documenting my concerns for future reference.

---

**Interviewer:** If your manager asks you to work overtime, but you have personal plans, how would you handle it?

**Thai:** I would be transparent - explain my personal commitment while showing willingness to help. I'd propose alternatives like coming early the next day, completing the task remotely later, or redistributing urgent work. If it's truly critical, I would negotiate - perhaps adjusting my personal plans or finding a compromise that serves both needs.

---

**Interviewer:** How do you handle an unexpected meeting when you're in the middle of another task?

**Thai:** I quickly note my current progress and context so I can resume efficiently. I assess the meeting urgency - if it's critical, I attend immediately; if not, I ask if I can join in 10-15 minutes to reach a natural stopping point. I keep my tasks organized so context-switching doesn't cause lost work.

---

**Interviewer:** What tools and strategies do you use to organize tasks to meet team goals?

**Thai:** For tools, I use Jira for sprint planning, backlog management, and tracking progress. Git or SVN for source control and code collaboration. And Jenkins CI/CD for automated deployment pipelines.

For strategies, I follow Scrum/Agile methodology with clear sprint goals. I create a Definition of Done for each story. I refine product backlogs regularly. I monitor sprint progress and team performance. I hold daily standups to identify blockers early. And I conduct code reviews to maintain quality.

---

**Interviewer:** Can you describe a time when you had to explain a technical concept to a non-technical customer? How did you make sure they understood?

**Thai:** In the TransactTrack project, I explained auto-parsing and CQRS concepts to business stakeholders. I used analogies - compared message parsing to a receptionist sorting mail by department. I created visual diagrams with simple flowcharts showing data flow. I focused on benefits - explaining what it does for them, like faster reports and accurate data, rather than how it works technically. And I asked for feedback - "Does this make sense?" - to ensure understanding.

---

**Interviewer:** How do you see yourself in the next 3 years?

**Thai:** I see AI-assisted coding tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Antigravity as a major trend shaping our industry. In the next 3 years, I want to master working effectively with these AI systems to boost productivity and code quality. At the same time, I'm very mindful of data protection - learning how to leverage AI tools while ensuring client data remains secure and never exposed to external systems. Beyond that, I want to continue designing modern, practical architectures and expand my leadership impact by mentoring developers and leading larger projects.

---

**Interviewer:** What is the role of a front-end, backend, or full-stack developer in a project?

**Thai:** A backend developer designs and implements APIs and business logic, handles database design, optimization, and management, takes care of system integration and security, and works on performance tuning and scalability.

A frontend developer builds user interfaces and user experience, implements responsive designs, handles client-side state management, and integrates with backend APIs.

A full-stack developer bridges frontend and backend, handles end-to-end feature implementation, makes architecture decisions across the stack, and has flexibility to help where needed.

---

**Interviewer:** What was the size of your last project team?

**Thai:** My most recent project, SBS Ricoh - RLIW from January to November 2025, had 6 members. Before that, TransactTrack had 8 members, and the Ride Hailing super-app had 20 members.

---

**Interviewer:** Tell me about one of the projects that inspired you the most. Did you face any difficulties?

**Thai:** Ride Hailing from 2022 to 2023 - building a super-app like Grab was most inspiring.

The difficulties included real-time tracking - implementing live driver and trip tracking required careful architecture. Scalability was another challenge - handling concurrent users with location-based services. And coordinating Flutter mobile apps with backend services across multiple platforms was complex.

For solutions, I designed a Backend-for-Frontend architecture to manage complexity. I applied Clean Architecture for maintainable code. I used Google Firebase for real-time features and GCP Kubernetes for scaling. And I established CI/CD with Jenkins and Microsoft App Center.

---

**Interviewer:** Have you had any success in your last project?

**Thai:** In my most recent project - the Internal Developer Portal MVP using Backstage - the customer was satisfied with the deliverables and the feedback was positive. We successfully built the permission system and delivered the MVP on target. However, there's no information yet about the next steps or whether the project will continue beyond the MVP phase. Before that, in SBS Ricoh WMS, I fixed production issues and improved system stability across core modules, optimized DB2 queries to improve processing speed, and modernized legacy RPG code for better maintainability.

---

**Interviewer:** How do you manage your time when an urgent meeting is scheduled unexpectedly?

**Thai:** I quickly note my current progress and context so I can resume efficiently. I assess the meeting urgency - if it's critical, I attend immediately; if not, I ask if I can join in 10-15 minutes to reach a natural stopping point. I maintain organized task lists so I can quickly resume work after interruptions.

---

**Interviewer:** Give me a quick summary - why should we select you for the project?

**Thai:** You should select me because I bring 18+ years of proven experience across the full SDLC. I have recognized expertise in modern architectures like Microservices, DDD, and Clean Architecture. I have leadership ability - I've led teams of 2 to 20 people successfully. I'm adaptable - I recently mastered AS/400/RPGLE for a new project domain. I have full-stack capability across Backend, Mobile, Frontend, and DevOps. I have strong communication skills and work smoothly in English with stakeholder management experience. And I have a mentor mindset - I don't just deliver code, I grow teams.

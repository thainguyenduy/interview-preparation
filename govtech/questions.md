## 3. What's a New Software or Technology You Recently Worked With

"Recently at FPT (Jan-Nov 2025), I worked with **IBM i (AS/400) platform** and **RPGLE/SQLRPGLE** on the SBS Ricoh Warehouse Management System. This was new territory for me - working with legacy systems and **DB2 databases**. I modernized legacy RPG code to free-format for better maintainability while optimizing query performance. Additionally, I used **BizBrowser** for front-end development in this project."

## 4.1. Apart from completing the tasks, what Values contribute to the projects

- **Architecture & Design**: I design modern, practical, and reliable systems using Clean Architecture, DDD, and appropriate design patterns
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Teaching, mentoring, coaching team members to grow their skills
- **Process Improvement**: Implementing Scrum methodology, creating Definition of Done rules, refining product backlogs
- **Quality Assurance**: Code reviews, establishing QA steps, ensuring maintainable code
- **Technical Decision Making**: Selecting modern tech stacks that fit project needs
- **Team Performance**: Monitoring sprint progress and tracking team performance

---

## 4.2. The leader Assigned you a task - but you have no experience -> how do you solve the task?

"This happened recently with the AS/400/RPGLE project at SBS Ricoh. My approach:
1. **Self-learning first**: Research documentation, tutorials, best practices
2. **Analyze existing code**: Study the codebase to understand patterns and conventions
3. **Break down the problem**: Divide the task into smaller, manageable pieces
4. **Ask for guidance**: Consult with experienced colleagues or client experts
5. **Prototype and iterate**: Start with small implementations, get feedback, improve
6. **Document learnings**: Share knowledge with team to prevent future blockers"

---

## 5. If you have an idea to contribute to the project but no one agrees, what will you do to convince them?

"I would:
1. **Prepare evidence**: Gather data, benchmarks, or case studies supporting my idea
2. **Create a prototype/POC**: Show rather than tell - demonstrate the solution working
3. **Address concerns**: Listen to objections and address them specifically
4. **Find common ground**: Identify shared goals and show how my idea achieves them
5. **Propose a pilot**: Suggest testing on a small scale to reduce risk
6. **Accept feedback**: If the team still disagrees after discussion, I respect the collective decision while documenting my concerns for future reference"

---

## If your manager asks you to work overtime, but you have personal plans, how would you handle the situation?

"I would be transparent: explain my personal commitment while showing willingness to help. I'd propose alternatives like coming early the next day, completing the task remotely later, or redistributing urgent work. If it's truly critical, I would negotiate - perhaps adjusting my personal plans or finding a compromise that serves both needs."

---

## How do you handle an unexpected meeting when you're in the middle of another task?

"I quickly note my current progress and context so I can resume efficiently. I assess the meeting urgency - if it's critical, I attend immediately; if not, I ask if I can join in 10-15 minutes to reach a natural stopping point. I keep my tasks organized so context-switching doesn't cause lost work."

---

## 6. Tools + strategies use to organize tasks to meet team goals

**Tools:**
- **Jira**: Sprint planning, backlog management, tracking progress
- **Git/SVN**: Source control and code collaboration
- **Jenkins CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipelines

**Strategies:**
- Scrum/Agile methodology with clear sprint goals

---

## Can you describe a time when you had to explain a technical concept to a non-technical customer? How did you make sure that they understood you?

"In the **TransactTrack** project, I explained auto-parsing and CQRS concepts to business stakeholders. I used:
- **Analogies**: Compared message parsing to a receptionist sorting mail by department
- **Visual diagrams**: Simple flowcharts showing data flow
- **Focus on benefits**: Explained what it does for them (faster reports, accurate data) rather than how it works technically
- **Asked for feedback**: 'Does this make sense?' to ensure understanding"

---

## 7. How do you see yourself in the next 3 years?

"My objectives are to:
1. **Design modern, practical systems** - Continue architecting solutions for clients
